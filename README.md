# Copia Fullstack Technical Challenge (Pt 1)

# The Challenge

* The endpoint should be performant (quicker the better but no more than 10 seconds)

## BONUS:
* Parse the CSV and load the user data into a database of your choice. Then implement the endpoint to query from the database to return the JSON.





# Instructions for running:
Install python dependencies:

> pip install flask
> pip install phonenumbers

Run the Flask server:
> python index.py

Run the GET request in another window, or navigate to the URL in browser:
> curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
